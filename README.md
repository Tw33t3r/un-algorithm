## TODO

### Major
 - Currently there is no easy way to import youtube subscriptions. Youtube doesn't export any api, Scraping the subscriptions page of a public channel only supplies the first 20 or so channels. This is a major problem with UX as a user has to copy each of their youtube subscriptions by hand.

### Minor
 - Specify how often youtube videos are grabbed.

### Features
- Add download from specific date
- Better Styling
- Search videos from creator
